## 📝 Description

**Roll the Dice** is a simple and fun web game that simulates the rolling of two dice. When the user clicks the "Roll" button, the dice images update randomly to display a number between 1 and 6, and the result is shown dynamically.

This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and image updating based on random values.
